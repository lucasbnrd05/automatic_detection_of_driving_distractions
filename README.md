# 🚗 Automatic Detection of Driving Distractions

## 📌 Overview
This project is an embedded system designed to detect driver distractions using multiple sensors and actuators. The system analyzes real-time data from various sensors to determine potential distractions and responds accordingly to alert the driver or take corrective action.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Real-time monitoring** of head movements, steering behavior, speed, and safe distance.<br>
✅ **Multiple sensors** including gyroscope, steering wheel position sensor, speedometer, and ultrasonic distance sensor.<br>
✅ **Automated alerts** via warning lights and display.<br>
✅ **Automatic braking system** for critical situations.<br>

## 🛠 System Components
### 📡 Sensors
- 📏 **Gyroscope**: Measures head tilt on X and Y axes to detect drowsiness or distraction.
- 🔄 **Steering Wheel Rotation Sensor**: Monitors erratic steering behaviors.
- 🚦 **Speedometer**: Measures vehicle speed.
- 📡 **Distance Sensor**: Detects unsafe following distances.

### 🚨 Actuators
- 💡 **Warning Lights**: Yellow and red lights for different risk levels.
- 📺 **Display**: Shows alerts and relevant data.
- 🛑 **Automatic Brakes**: Engages at varying intensities based on risk level.

## 📊 Symptom Detection Logic
| 🛑 Condition | ⏱ Detection Interval | 🔍 Criteria |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Head Tilt (S1)** | 400ms | X-axis > ±30° (drowsiness/distraction), Y-axis > ±30° (unless turning) |
| **Unsafe Distance (D1, D2, D3)** | 300ms | Distance < Safe Distance Threshold |
| **Sharp Turn (S2)** | 350ms | Steering angle changes > 20° at speeds > 40km/h |

## 🚦 System Actions
| 🚧 Condition | 🏎 Action |
|-----------|--------|
| (S1 or S2) and D0 | 🟡 Turn on Light 1 |
| (S1 and S2) and D0 | 🔴 Turn on Light 2 |
| (S1 or S2) and D1 | 🟡🔴 Turn on Light 1 & Light 2, Brake Level 1 |
| (S1 or S2) and D2 | 🟡🔴 Turn on Light 1 & Light 2, Brake Level 2 |
| D3 | 🛑 Brake Level 3 |

## 🖥 Installation & Execution
